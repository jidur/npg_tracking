npg_tracking::glossary::composition::factory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package my::component;
  use Moose;
  has 'attr_1' => (isa => 'Int', is => 'ro', required => 1,);
  has 'attr_2' => (isa => 'Str', is => 'ro', required => 1,);
  1;

  package my::composition;
  use Moose;
  use npg_tracking::glossary::composition::factory;

  my $factory = npg_tracking::glossary::composition::factory->new();
  $factory->add_component(my::component->new(attr_1 => 1, attr_2 => 'a'));
  $factory->add_component(my::component->new(attr_1 => 2, attr_2 => 'b'));
  my $composition = $factory->create_composition();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generic factory functionality for npg_tracking::glossary::composition type objects.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 add_component

Stores a single component object or a list of component objects
inside the factory.

  $factory->add($component);
  $factory->add((($component1, $component2));

Gives an error if a list of components contains duplicates or if any of
the argument components have been already given to this factory.

Cannot be called after the create_composition() method has been called;

=cut

=head2 create_composition

Returns a composition containing all components added to the factory.
Can only be called once. The order of the objects in the array is not necessary
the same as the order the objects were added to the factory.

  $factory->create_composition();
